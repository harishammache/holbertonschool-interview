## Description

This project implements a function that calculates the perimeter of an island represented by a 2D grid.

The island is made of land cells (`1`) surrounded by water cells (`0`). Each land cell contributes to the total perimeter depending on how many of its sides are adjacent to water or the edge of the grid.

## Problem Constraints

- `0` represents water
- `1` represents land
- Each cell is square with a side length of 1
- Cells are connected **horizontally** and **vertically**, not diagonally
- The grid is **rectangular**, with width and height not exceeding **100**
- The grid is **entirely surrounded by water**
- There is **only one island** (or none)
- The island does **not contain lakes** (water inside not connected to surrounding water)
