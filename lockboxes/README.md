<h1 align="center">Lockboxes</h1>

## Description

This project implements an algorithm to determine whether all boxes in a list can be opened.  
Each box may contain keys to other boxes, and the goal is to use these keys efficiently to access every box.

This algorithm is a typical depth-first search (DFS) exploration problem and introduces problem-solving using graph traversal concepts.
